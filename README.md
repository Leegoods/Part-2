1.	Set up your development environment:
•	Install a C# development environment such as Visual Studio or JetBrains Rider.
•	Ensure that the .NET framework is installed on your system.
2.	Create a new C# project:
•	Open your preferred C# development environment.
•	Create a new project and select the appropriate project type for a console application.
3.	Copy the classes:
•	Replace the existing Program.cs file with the code provided in the previous response.
•	Add the necessary references (e.g., using System;, using System.Collections.Generic;, etc.) at the top of the file.
4.	Build the project:
•	Build the project to compile the code and check for any compilation errors.
•	If there are any errors, resolve them before proceeding.
5.	Run the application:
•	If using Visual Studio:
•	Press the Start button or use the keyboard shortcut (F5) to run the application.
•	The console window will appear, displaying the output based on the code in the Main method.
•	If using another development environment or command-line:
•	Use the appropriate method to run a C# console application.
•	The console window will appear, and the application will start executing the code in the Main method.
6.	Interact with the application:
•	The application will display the available recipes, their details, and the total calories.
•	Follow the on-screen prompts or modify the code to suit your specific requirements.
7.	Test the unit test (optional):
•	If you have added the unit test code, you can run the test to verify the total calorie calculation.
•	In your development environment, find the option to run tests or use a testing framework's command-line interface.
•	The test results will be displayed, indicating whether the test passed or failed.
